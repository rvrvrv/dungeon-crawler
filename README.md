Dungeon Crawler React Project for FreeCodeCamp

## User stories:
1. I have health, a level, and a weapon. I can pick up a better weapon. I can pick up health items.
2. All the items and enemies on the map are arranged at random.
3. I can move throughout a map and discover items.
4. I can move anywhere within the map's boundaries, but I can't move through an enemy until I've beaten it.
5. Much of the map is hidden. When I take a step, all spaces within a certain distance are revealed.
6. When I beat an enemy, the enemy goes away and I get XP, which eventually increases my level.
7. When I fight an enemy, we take turns damaging each other until one of us loses. I inflict damage based on my level and weapon. The enemy inflicts damage based on its level. Damage is somewhat random within a range.
8. When I find and beat the boss, I win.
9. The game should be challenging, but theoretically winnable.
